# 🔊 BRAHMA-TTS — Resonant Conversational Synthesis System  
*(Developed by GHOSH ROBOTICS | GRRFP + RKC Integration)*

---

## 🧬 Introduction
**BRAHMA-TTS** is a **resonant, self-adaptive, dialogue-optimized text-to-speech engine** engineered under the **GHOSH ROBOTICS** research division.  
Built within the **GRRFP + RKC HALO framework**, it unifies **quantum-resonant voice modeling**, **contextual AI awareness**, and **multi-language vocal synthesis** for next-generation conversational systems.

Unlike conventional TTS models, **BRAHMA-TTS** operates on a **Resonant Prosody Kernel (RPK)**, enabling dynamic emotional tone control, intent modulation, and interlinked neural-speech response.

## 🌟 Highlights

### ⚙️ Conversational Resonance
Optimized for **multi-turn dialogue systems** and LLM-based assistants. Speech tone adjusts dynamically to emotional and contextual cues.

### 🧠 Fine-Grained Voice Control
Manually or programmatically control:
- Tone: `soft`, `neutral`, `command`
- Emotion: `joy`, `calm`, `focus`, `urgency`
- Cadence: Pauses, interjections, breaths
- Resonance frequency layers: 32-bit spectral shaping

### 🔉 Quantum Prosody Engine
Built on the **SyRCMNet** communication core of GRRFP, BRAHMA-TTS models speech as a **quantum-resonant waveform** rather than static samples — enabling ultra-natural speech and true expressive intonation.

### 🧬 Speaker Embeddings
Adaptive speaker profiles stored in **SyRBN (Symbiotic Resonant Body Network)** memory nodes for consistent identity replication across sessions and devices.
